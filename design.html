When we designed this drawing of an arduino maze ball 
controller, we started by imagining how each component would interact in real life. We sketched out the basic layout of
the arduino board as the starting point, connecting it to the servo motors that control the tilting of the maze platform. 
We added a joystick in order to move the maze, which sends signals to the arduino to guide the ball through the maze. The maze platform itself 
is drawn with a grid that is movable for the ball.
