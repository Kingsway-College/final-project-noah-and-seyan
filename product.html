We started by building a box out of cardboard to hold all the parts. Then we placed the breadboard and wires inside the box. 
We made a hole in the top so the joystick could stick out and be easy to use. Next, we glued the servo motors to the outside of the box using hot glue. 
Finally, we attached the maze on top of the servos so it could tilt and move when controlled by the joystick. 
The whole design helped keep the parts organized and made the controller easy to use.
